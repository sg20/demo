Load Balancer Benefits
A load balancer distributes workloads across multiple compute resources, such as virtual servers. Using a load balancer increases the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.

You can add and remove compute resources from your load balancer as your needs change, without disrupting the overall flow of requests to your applications.

You can configure health checks, which are used to monitor the health of the compute resources so that the load balancer can send requests only to the healthy ones. You can also offload the work of encryption and decryption to your load balancer so that your compute resources can focus on their main work.
